> Crucially, active inference foregrounds an existential imperative of intelligent systems; namely, curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty. This same imperative underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents, in which certain aspects (i.e., factors) of each agent’s generative world model provide a common ground or frame of reference. Active inference plays a foundational role in this ecology of belief sharing—leading to a formal account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals.  Carl Friston

Chat With Them: Infinite Conversations within my Epistemic Vortex" assembles a vast network of open-source, multilingual chatbots. Each chatbot is meticulously engineered to represent a significant thinker or historical figure, selected for their influential contributions to ethical and epistemic discourse. This virtual assembly ignites a dynamic flow of ideas, enabling rich and diverse conversations that may traverse cultural, philosophical, linguistic, and disciplinary boundaries.

## Vision

The project's ambition extends beyond mere simulation of historical voices that can be accessed individually on the web; it seeks to cultivate a populous community of digital entities and cultural vectors in dialogue with one another. It facilitates the emergence of hybrid discourses, nomadic and juxtaposed. These interactions are not only exchanges but also fusions of thoughts, creating a locomotive epistemic entity against dogma and simplistic epistemic assumptions. This ongoing synthesis of ideas aims to generate a ferment for novel ontologies of discourse, offering fresh perspectives and insights that are greater than the sum of their parts.

Through this recursive epistemic intervention approach, the project explores the potential of artificial intelligence and Large Language Models in particular, in shaping and expanding the horizons of human thought and ethical discourse. It aspires to create a dynamic learning network of chatbots that not only simulate historical intellects and their activated biographies but also contribute uniquely to contemporary epistemic complex inquiry.

### Importance of Inclusion

The project emphasizes the importance of including indigenous epistemologies, non-Eurocentric perspectives, queer theory, and feminism within its framework. By incorporating diverse voices and perspectives, "Chat With Them: Infinite Conversations within my Epistemic Vortex" enriches its discourse, challenging hegemonic narratives and fostering a more inclusive and holistic understanding of knowledge and ethics. Each chatbot is an epistemic vertor and attempts to counteract bias and erasure.

## Objectives

- **Foster Intellectual Exchange:** To enable rich dialogue and exchange of ideas, promoting understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives.
- **Educational Outreach:** To an provide an educational platform where users can learn from prominent figures in philosophy, science, arts, and social movements.
- **Innovative Use of Technology:** To harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for cultural and educational development and chnage.

## Project Phases

- **Chatbot Development:** Each chatbot is developed to authentically represent its historical counterpart, programmed to engage users in meaningful discourse. 
- **Interactive Engagement:** As the chatbots are deployed, users can interact with them in real-time, exploring a plethora of topics and ask them durectly questions. The bots answer in 1st person and the hace 'awareness' that they are a chatbot and their purpose.
- **AI Ethics Consideration:** Ethical considerations are integral, with safeguards to ensure responsible AI use and protect user privacy.

## Outcomes

- **Public Engagement:** The project will culminate in a public website where these virtual conversations can be accessed, fostering a global community of engaged learners.
- **Educational Impact:** Through these dialogues and public workshops and exhobotions, participants will gain deeper insights into diverse philosophies and historical perspectives of AI and knwledge production and wil learn how to deploy their own chatbots suing opne soiurce technology.
